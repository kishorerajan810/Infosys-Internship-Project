PROBLEM DEFINITION


A population projection gives a picture of what the future size and structure of the population by sex and age might look like. It is based on knowledge of the past trends, and, for the future, on assumptions made for three components: fertility, mortality and migration. Individual behaviour, certain public policy actions, scientific progress or unforeseen events (weather events, epidemics) in the coming years may have a lasting effect and significantly influence trends, which the projections do not take into account. Unfortunately, not understanding population projections can lead to much larger problems than a rained out barbecue. Every population projection has a margin of error, just like weather forecasts do. The most commonly accepted margin of error for 10-year population projections at county level is 12 percent
